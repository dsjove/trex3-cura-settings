# trex3-cura-settings
The goal of this repo is to create a unified snapshot of all the Cura 4.0 settings relevant to a TRex 3 printer. The printer is distributed with out-of-date Cura settings. I have found a lot of help on various Facrbook forums but the information has at times been incomplete, not without gotchas, and human error (transcribing). As I learn and extend my Cura settings, I'll update this repo.

Whether you are a newbie (like me) or a seasoned printer, I would very much appreciate pull requests to further update this suite of settings.
