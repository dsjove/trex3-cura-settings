# trex3-cura-settings
The goal of this repo is to create a unified snapshot of all the Cura 4.0 settings relevant to a TRex 3 printer. The printer is distributed with out-of-date Cura settings. I have found a lot of help on various Facrbook formums put the information has not been complete nor without gotchas and human error. As I learn and extend my Cura settings, I'll update this.

Whether you are a newbie (like me) or a seasoned printer, I would very much appreciate pull requests to further update this suite of settings.

On the Mac:
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/cura/4.0 ~/Library/Application\ Support/cura/old4.0
git clone https://github.com/dsjove/trex3-cura-settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/cura/

On Windows:
...

On Linux:
...

Printers:
"TRex-3 Single Left" - standard print
"TRex-3 Single Right" - standard print but with right extruder
"TRex-3 Single Duplicate" - use TRex duplicate feature
"TRex-3 Single Mirror" - use TRex mirror feature
"TRex-3 Dual" - dual color

Material:
"TRex-3 PLA" - corrects default temperature and retraction settings

Profiles:
"Standard Draft" - adjusts defaults given TRex's printing capabilities

Current Status:

"TRex-3 Single Left" is the only machine with known correct GCode.
